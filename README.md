Hello!!

I'm currently working on a simple webpage called <a href="https://b-rajshekar.github.io/tribute-page/">tribute-page</a>,
and also learning about git and github from CS50.

This is actually the project from freeCodeCamp, which I'm working on, Hope it turns out well.
Hence, I'm doing this to learn HTML-5, CSS-3, and also JavaScript.
